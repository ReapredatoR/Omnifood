Omni Food Project

Udemy -Build Responsive Real-World Websites, Jonas Schmedtmann

Used Technologies - HTML, CSS, JavaScript

-For the Omni Food Project in Jonas Schmedtmann's Udemy course, I developed a responsive and interactive website for a fictional food delivery service using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I designed and coded the website's structure and appearance, using JavaScript to create dynamic functionality such as scrolling animations, responsive navigation, and form validation.
Through this project, I gained experience in web development and demonstrated my skills in creating responsive and interactive websites using these technologies.
